Mars rover challenge

The program takes the content of the file and process the values accodingly

To make sure that the code is correct, i started using inputing values via the console

And also using a chess board to figure out the end results

The program is also dynamic, you can update the contents of the file and still works, as long as same rules are followed.

Program can be run on console example:

~/MarsRover $ ruby Rover.rb   
#the command above will display below results

Rover Position: 3 3 S  
#(3 3 s) being the location

The results are detaermined by the below contents of a file:
